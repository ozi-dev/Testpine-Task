# Testpine Task

Testpine Task is a simple, yet powerful web application that allows users to drag and drop blocks of content onto a workspace, add form elements to them and then save and display the results. The tool was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features


* **Drag-and-drop functionality:** Users can easily drag and drop blocks of content onto the workspace to create custom forms.
* **Form element customization:** Each block type has a unique set of form elements that can be customized to fit the user's needs. Users can add text inputs, dropdown menus and more.
* **Real-time updates:** As users add form elements, the workspace dynamically updates to reflect those changes in real-time.
* **Re-positioning:** Users can reposition blocks on the workspace by clicking and dragging them around.
* **Deletion:** Users can remove any block from the workspace by clicking the delete button.
